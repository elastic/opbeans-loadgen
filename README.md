This is a load generator for [Opbeans](https://github.com/elastic?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Opbeans&type=&language=) as a Docker container.

Start the docker container with a list of base URLs to generate load on

    docker run --rm -e OPBEANS_URLS=opbeans-node:http://opbeans-node:3000,opbeans-python:http://opbeans-python:3000 opbeans/opbeans-loadgen
